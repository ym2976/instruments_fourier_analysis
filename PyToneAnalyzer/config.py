config
======

This configuration file contains constants used throughout the project.

The config file is expected to be in the predefined format, otherwise the program
may not work as expected. In case the user wants to change the default values, it
is recommended to consult the documentation first! This will be the case for any
nontrivial usage of the package.

The documentation can be found in the
GitHub repository of the project: github.com/gilja/instruments_fourier_analysis

Constants:
----------

-   PACKAGE_INSTALLATION_PATH: Path to the package installation folder.
-   PATH_BASE: Base path of the project.
-   PATH_DATA: Path to the data folder.
-   PATH_RESULTS: Path to the results folder.
-   PATH_INSTRUMENT_SAMPLES: Path to the instrument samples folder.

-   FIGURE_WIDTH: Width of the figure.
-   FIGURE_HEIGHT: Height of the figure.
-   FIGURE_HEIGHT_PER_PLOT: Height of each individual plot.
-   HSPACING: Horizontal spacing between subplots.
-   VSPACING: Vertical spacing between subplots.
-   Y_AXIS_MARGIN: Y-axis range margin when exporting individual harmonics to PDF.

-   WAVEFORM_ZOOM_PERCENTAGES: Waveform zoom percentage for each instrument.
-   N_HARMONICS_PER_INSTRUMENT: Number of harmonics to be used in the Fourier analysis for each
    instrument.

-   NOTE_FREQUENCIES: Note corresponding to each frequency.
-   AUDIO_DURATION: Duration of exported individual harmonic audio files.
-   SAMPLE_RATE: Sample rate of exported individual harmonic audio files.

-   PERIOD_BOUNDS: Period bounds for each instrument used in the Fourier analysis. The bounds are
    obtained manually by plotting waveform of each audio file and identifying the periods visually.
    The order of the instruments is the same as in the N_HARMONICS_PER_INSTRUMENT and the
    WAVEFORM_ZOOM_PERCENTAGES.
